# scoliosis-detection
This project interests me because my sister discovered that she had scoliosis when it was already passed the point of needing surgery. If we can predict how a child's spine will grow based on x-rays taken, we can see if there is any need for corrective bracing. 

First train program to detect if the spine has a deformity. Then trying to use image segmentation techniques to separate the spine from the rest of the x-ray, decide the angle of curvature, and then predict future bending
